<p>Chengdu is probably the laziest city among China's new first-tier cities.</p>

<p>There has always been a teahouse on every corner in the city. The daily ritual of stopping at a teahouse to meet friends and chat began in Chengdu at least 1,000 years ago. <strong>Take a seat and sip a cup of tea</strong>. Your guide will explain the etiquette to you of how to drink tea and the intentions you express when you put the lid, bowl, and tray in different places.</p>

<p><strong>Square dancing</strong> is already a part of the locals’ lifestyle and the dance form nowadays is much more interesting and uniquely Chinese. Feel the good vibes and join in with line dancing, a waltz, or a little Chinese salsa if you want to.</p>

<p>You will also see some vibrant scenes that may only happen in Chengdu: desperate parents are posting messages in a <strong>marriage market</strong> looking for a partner for their unmarried offspring; a local man is enjoying a traditional teahouse <strong>strong&gt;ear massage</strong> with a metal rod in his ear; Chengdunese are <strong>playing mahjong</strong> everywhere in summer - even in the river.</p>

<p>Chengdu was inhabited over 4,000 years ago and was once the center of the ancient Shu culture. It is a miracle that you can still trace its cultural features today in the city.</p>

<p>Tianfu Square is <strong>the geographical center and important landmark of Chengdu</strong>. From above, it looks like a huge tai chi pattern depicting yin and yang, and you can see the image of a flying sunbird in the center, which is the emblem of the city.</p>

<h2>Trip Notes</h2>

<h3>1. Customizing the Tour - According to Your Needs</h3>

<p>This tour is very flexible. You can alter the itinerary, extending or shortening it to suit your price, interests, and schedule.</p>

<h3>2. Tibet Travel Permit</h3>

<p>You will need a Tibet Entry Permit. Its cost is included in the tour quotation. Send your passport and China visa copies to us 20 days in advance, and we will apply for your permit once you book a Tibetan tour with us.</p>

<p>In our experience, we can virtually guarantee to get your permit during times when Tibet is open to foreign travelers.</p>

<h3>3. Altitude Sickness</h3>

<p>Before your trip, ask your doctor for any suggestions in relation to altitude sickness and take some medicine with you, just in case. The most popular altitude medicine among foreigners is Acetazolamide/Diamox. We recommend that during the first 2 days after arriving in Tibet, you should keep warm, avoid taking a bath, and refrain from smoking or drinking alcohol.</p>

<p>Drink plenty of water (more than 4 liters per day) before you go out and when you have reached a higher altitude, and eat lots of vegetables and carbohydrates. Slow down, even if you feel energetic. Moving slowly is the best way to avoid altitude sickness.</p>

<p>If you don't feel well after entering Tibet, go and see a doctor as soon as possible. There are doctors in major hotels in Lhasa, and you can call your tour guide for help at any time. We offer a free oxygen bag in the car.</p>

<h3>4. General rules for visiting temples in Tibet:</h3>

<p>Cameras are not allowed in the temples or in the debate field, but taking photos with a cell phone is acceptable.</p>

<p>When entering a temple, please take off your hat and sunglasses to show respect. Your shoulders should be covered and you should not wear shorts.</p>

<p>Walk clockwise when visiting Barkhor Street.</p>
