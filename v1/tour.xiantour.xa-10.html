You’ll be picked up by private car or van, and then head to the Terracotta Warriors Museum in Lintong District. It’s about a one-hour drive. Lintong is famous for fruit, such as juicy pomegranates and golden persimmons, and you’ll have the chance to buy some fruit from local vendors.</p><p><strong>10:00am–12:00pm: Visit the Terracotta Warriors Museum</strong></p><p>It is worth having a knowledgeable guide with you to explain everything in the museum. Usually China Highlights guides visit it over 150 times per year.</p><p>The highlights of the museum are the three pits (Pit One, Pit Two, and Pit Three) where the warriors are on display, and the Exhibition of Bronze Chariots. Pit One is the largest and most impressive, with about 2,000 terracotta warriors on display. Pit Two uncovers the mystery of the ancient army formation. Pit Three represents the command post.</p><p>Our tour also includes Emperor Qin Shihuang's Mausoleum Site Park with the Museum of Terracotta Acrobats, Museum of Terracotta Civil Officials, Museum of Stone Armor, and Museum of Bronze Chariots and Horses. This park near the Terracotta Army is also a pleasant place to visit.</p><div>

The walls, ramparts, gates, and watchtowers form one of the oldest and most complete city defenses in China. If the weather is good, cycling will be incorporated into the visit, and you will enjoy some good views of the city.</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="The Ancient City Wall" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/xian/xa-10-wall.jpg"></div><p><strong>3:00–5:00pm: Muslim Quarter and Drive Back to Your Hotel</strong></p><p>Your tour is not only full of history but also has the vivid flavor of local life.
