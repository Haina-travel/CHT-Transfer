Hanging Temple Tips:</h3><p>Comfortable shoes and a light backpack are suggested, as for all excursions.</p><p>The stairs to the Hanging Temple are narrow, only allowing one person to pass, and the rail is short, so be careful. It is 60 to 90 meters above the ground, so people who fear heights should consider this before going up.</p><p>Continuing heavy rain might cause rock falls, so for safety the temple will be closed in bad weather.</p><p>The viewing platform that under the mountain and opposite the river is a great place to have a full view of the Hanging Temple. People can take pictures from the square if they don’t plan to go up, or when the temple was closed due to bad weather.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the continuing rain and large area rock falls, <strong>tourists are not allowed to climb the mountain and go into the Hanging Temple since 13th Oct. 2015</strong>. People can still have a full view of the Hanging Temple at the viewing platform that under the mountain and opposite the river. We will continue to watch the situation and update the information.</p><h3>2.
