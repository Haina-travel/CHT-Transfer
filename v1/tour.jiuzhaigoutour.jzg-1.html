                1.	Tailoring Your Private Tour
              </h3><p>
                <strong>This tour is very flexible</strong>. Your can alter the itinerary, and extend or shorten it to suit your price, interest, and schedule. Feel free to tell us your requirements, and we will be happy to help you arrange a tour using our professional knowledge and experience. We promise a <strong>"No Shopping Policy"</strong>.
              </p><p>
                An expensive private transfer takes up a large proportion of the high cost of a Jiuzhaigou tour. In this tour, for a group of <strong>one to two people</strong>, our guide will accompany you to take a taxi between the airport, hotel, and scenic spots in Jiuzhaigou. For <strong>bigger groups</strong>, to make sure you have enough comfortable room for both people and luggage, we will arrange a <strong>7-seater van</strong> or <strong>larger minibus</strong> for you.
              </p><h3>
                3. Possible altitude sickness
              </h3><p>
                At Jiuzhaigou, the altitude varies a lot. For example, the valley entrance is at about 2,000 meters, while the airport is at about 3,500 meters.  Vulnerability to altitude sickness varies from person to person, so it is suggested you consult your doctor before the trip. Visitors with heart disease or high blood pressure should be careful and take appropriate precautions when traveling to Jiuzhaigou.
              </p><p>
                When in Huanglong and Jiuzhaigou, please do not drink wine, in case of a negative reaction to the altitude. Stay warm and eat plenty of vegetables and fruit. Take some common medicines with you. If you like, your guide can prepare a <strong>small oxygen bottle</strong> for you, just in case.
              </p><h3>
                4. Hotels in and around Jiuzhaigou
              </h3><p>
                The most popular place for hotels is <strong>Zhangzha Town</strong>, which is <strong>closest to the entrance of Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve</strong>. Zhangzha has a wide range of accommodation, from 5* hotels to budget hostels.<br>
  If you prefer to be close to <strong>Huanglong National Park or Jiuzhuang Airport</strong>, you may choose a hotel in <strong>Chuanzhusi County</strong>.<br>
  If <strong>Muni Valley (Munigou)</strong> is on your list of places-to-go, you may consider staying in <strong>Songpan Town</strong>.
              </p><p>
                <strong>The standards of most hotels in the area are not as good as those of equivalent star-levels in the West</strong>. China Highlights has carefully selected the best hotel available, based on criteria like hotel environment, location, service, and previous customer feedback. Your guide will accompany you to see your room. If you are dissatisfied and there are other rooms available, your guide will be happy to assist you with changing rooms.<br>
  Some hotels may close from <strong>late November to February of the next year</strong>. Please inquire and we will check availability for you.
              </p><h3>
                5. Why Would I Need a Guide in Jiuzhaigoiu National Park?
              </h3><p>
                The park is huge! It covers a little over 700 sq km and the routes are almost 100 km (62 miles) long. No matter how many strategies you read, it’s a big challenge to visit all the spots in one or two days. Our guides help to make the most of your time in the park — our guides are local and experienced, spending over 200 days in the park every year. They know the valleys and lakes like their own backyards. Just follow them and you will not have to bother about looking at signs and maps. <br>
  Based on your strength and the weather, our guide will show you the best route for sightseeing and inform you about the dangerous parts during the tour. They will also assist you to arrange the lunch properly. When you get tired of walking on the endless plank, they can tell you how much longer it is to reach the next lake or bus stop. They know which sections of plank are worth walking, and which ones are crowded, steep, or a waste of time and energy. <br>
  The guide will introduce you to all the information about the attractions and can take you to the best spots for photos.
