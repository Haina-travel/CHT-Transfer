                    Ancient Villages
                  </div><div class="ItineraryContent"><div class="infoimage"><img alt="" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/huangshan/sea-clouds.jpg"></div><p>Bright Top, one of the main peaks, is located in the middle of the Yellow Mountains. It is the second highest peak at about 1,860 meters above sea level.</p><p><strong>Good to know:</strong><br>
                  To take pictures of a sunrise and sunset, photography-lovers need to arrive at the places ahead of time because the best positions in these places are only big enough for fewer than 10 people.</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/huangshan/yellow-mountains-clouds.jpg"></div><p>The U-shaped Grand Valley is 12 kilometers long, with a maximum altitude difference of 400 meters. It is the most precipitous site with the most original natural view. Stone forests are everywhere and the walking distance is so long that it is a favorite destination for backpackers.</p><p>It takes over four hours to walk through the canyon. It is necessary to have sufficient water and food because there are no supplies along the way. The West Sea Grand Canyon closes from December to March of the following year due to the snowy weather.</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/huangshan/flying-over-rock.jpg"></div><p>Flying-Over Rock is seated at the northwest part of Bright Peak. It is nearly one kilometer away from Bright Top and about 1,730 meters above sea level. Flying-Over Rock is oddly shaped, being 12 meters high and 8 meters wide. Moreover, it weighs about 360 tons. It is amazing that such a stone stands upright on a 15 meters long and 10 meters wide flat stone.</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/huangshan/cloud-dispelling-pavilion.jpg"></div><p>Cloud-Dispelling Pavilion is about a one kilometer (0.6 mile) walk from Flying-Over Rock. Opposite the peaks, it is an ideal place in West Sea Grand Canyon to see the exquisite stones. From the pavilion, photography-lovers can have a good view of the hills and mountains that are sometimes half hidden in the mists, like islands in the sea.</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/huangshan/refreshing-terrace.jpg"></div><p>Refreshing Terrace sits on the side of the Lion Peak, projecting over a crag with three free surfaces. It is surrounded by cement balustrades which travelers can lean against to observe from the terrace. The scenery around there is wonderful: North Sea is in front, 18 spiral stone steps are below, and on the right is the Shisungang (/shrr-swnn-gung/ ‘Rock Bamboo Hill’), where the rocks and stones look like bamboo.</p>  </div>

                <h3>1. The Weather</h3>
                <p>The weather plays a very important role in a photography tour. Your guide is flexible, and can make appropriate changes based on the weather, after a discussion with you. If you encounter some bad weather for photography, your guide will try his/her best to take you to the place best suited to the weather conditions.</p>
                <h3>2. Luggage</h3>
                <p>Your guide will assist you to store big suitcase in your hotel in Tunxi (Huangshan City). You can collect it on your way back. You could also store the luggage at the foot of the mountain. The cost is about CNY20 (US$4) for each piece. If you need to carry heavy equipments onto the mountains, your guide can hire porter for you and the cost is CNY80-120 (US$13-20) for each piece.</p>
                <h3>3. Photography Guide on the Yellow Mountains</h3>
                <p>Your guide helps to maximize your time on the mountains: Our guides are local and experienced, who spend over 200 days on the mountains every year. They know the mountains like their own backyard. Just follow them and you didn't have to bother about looking at signs and maps. When you get tired climbing the endless steps, they can tell you how much longer to reach the destination. Even purchasing cable car tickets are easier as the guide will do it. Based on your strength and weather, our guide will show you the best route for sightseeing and inform you the dangerous parts during the tour. During different seasons of the year, the best position and angle for taking photos vary with the height of the sun. Your guide will show you the best time and locations. They will accompany you during your staying on the mountain until you go back to hotel for rest.</p>
                <h3>4. Reminder</h3>
                <p>West Sea Grand Canyon, Celestial Capital Peak, and Lotus Peak usually close from December to March of the following year due to the snowy weather. The guide will adjust the itinerary to cover other highlights to make the most of your time.</p>
                <p>From October 8th, 2014 to April 30th, 2015, Yuping Cable Car stops operation for its rebuilding work. During this period, more tourists will take Yungu Cable Car, so queuing is possible. Your guide will adjust the time and schedule flexibly to avoid crowds.</p>
