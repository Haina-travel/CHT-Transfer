							Trip Notes
						</h2><h3>
							1.Extension
						</h3><p>
							If you love both pandas and cooking, we can combine the Panda Breeding and Research Center and the Sichuan Cuisine Museum for you to make the most of your day. Suggested itinerary:<br>
<strong>9am -11am:</strong> Visit Panda Breeding and Research Center.<br>
<strong>12pm -1:30pm:</strong> Transfer to the Wide and Narrow Alleys for lunch.<br>
<strong>2:30pm-5pm:</strong> Cooking experience at Sichuan Cuisine Museum.<br>
<strong>5pm-5:30pm:</strong> Taste the dishes you have cooked for dinner and then head back to your hotel in Chengdu city.<br>
<strong>Prices per person:</strong><br>

<strong>Please take a camera.</strong> Your guide or the staff at the base will help take photos for you.
						</p><h3>
							2.	Customization
						</h3><p>
							Feel free to tell us <strong>your requirements and interests</strong>, and we will be happy to help you arrange a trip using our professional knowledge and experience.
						</p><h3>
							3.	Option to Save on Costs
						</h3><p>
							Since the guide at the Sichuan Cuisine Museum can speak fluent English, some customers prefer not arranging a tour guide to save on costs. In this case, we will arrange a professional driver for you. He/she will be able to speak simple English and our staff from a local agency will confirm the collection time and destination with you in advance. <br>
It will <strong>save you approximately US$50</strong> in total, depending on the date, number of members in your group, and your itinerary.
						</p><h3>
							4. Payment Methods:
						</h3><p>
							We now offer 3 payment methods: PayPal, credit card authorization via fax and wire transfer. PayPal is recommended for its safety and efficiency. You can pay USA dollars, Australian dollars, European dollars and Great Britain Pound directly with your credit card or debit card, even if you don't have PayPal account.
						</p><h3>
							5. Cancellation Policy:
						</h3><p>
							In the event of cancellation we will refund any payment made to China Highlights (unless any cancellation fee applicable) within 14 days of our receipt of your written cancellation request. Visit <a href="https://www.chinahighlights.com/aboutus/terms.htm">here</a> for more details.
						</p><h3>
							6. Gratuities to Guide or Driver
						</h3><p>
							Tips to the guide and driver are not included. If the guide's and driver's service truly satisfy you, our suggestion to the tips would be:<br>
1 person in the group, CNY150-200,<br>
2 people in a group: CNY100/person,<br>
3-5 people in a group: CNY50-70/person,<br>
6-9 people in a group: CNY40-50/person,<br>
≥10 people in a group: CNY20-30/person.<br>
The driver would be half the amount, and separate offer to each is best.
						</p><h3>

						</h3><p>
							Travel insurance is not included. We carefully selected some insurance providers from your region that give you the best value for money. Click <a href="/travelguide/insurance/">here</a> to go to the travel insurance page.
