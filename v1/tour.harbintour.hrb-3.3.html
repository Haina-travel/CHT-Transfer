              <strong>Central Street</strong> (small snow and ice sculptures): Open all the time, small snow and ice sculptures start to appear in the middle of December, if lucky enough, you will have a chance to see how people make the snow sculptures.</p>
              <h3>3. What I can do during the middle of December?</h3>
              <p>Before the official opening time of the Ice and Snow Festival, huge snow and ice sculptures are under building in the middle of December. As the parks are closed, people are unable to see the making process. However there are still other places to see. At the Central Street, you can see how people make snow sculptures if lucky enough. Take the warm shuttle bus in Siberian Tigers Park, you can see Siberian tigers in the outdoor. Enjoy the white whale and sea lion show at the Harbin Polarland, have a skiing day… although the Ice and Snow Festival didn’t start yet, you can still have fun in Harbin!</p>
              <h3>4. Protect your digital products</h3>
              <p>Batteries are affected easily by low temperature, when playing outside, please put your cell phone and camera in the bag. If you plan to take a lot of pictures, do bring a spare battery as batteries run out quickly in low temperature.</p>

  <h2>Our Service Includes:</h2><ul class="whatIncluded infolist">
              <li>Entrance to scenic spots listed in the itinerary</li>
              <li>Guiding by experienced English-speaking tour guide</li>
              <li>Private transfers between the airport, attractions, and hotel</li>
              <li>Lunches mentioned in the itinerary</li>
            </ul><h3>Why it is necessary to have a private tour?</h3><p>1. It’s not easy to find an empty taxi in Harbin especially in winter time. Taxies don’t go meter, and drivers charge directly. Most taxies will pick up other people on the way (carpooling), and it’s difficult to find a taxi at a remote attraction back to the downtown.</p><p>2. The average outdoor temperature in Harbin is -21℃/-5.8℉ during the winter time, and waiting for a bus in the open air can be very cold.</p><p>3. Public transportations can’t reach some attractions. For example, there is no bus to the Sun Island, and people have to change 2 buses to get to the Siberian Tiger Park.</p><p>A private tour will provide a private vehicle, and personal English speaking tour guide. We will pick you up from your hotel and drive to the attractions directly, save your time and avoid unnecessary tubules. All you need to do is sit back and enjoy the trip!</p>
