					Detailed Itinerary
				</h2><div class="tourDates">
							08:00AM-08:45AM: Guilin Hotel pick up
						</div><p>
							Pick-up starts from the southern part of  the city and moves to the eastern. Travelers who stay near Guilin Railway  Station will be the first ones to get picked up, later are the ones at the city  center (08:15-08:30, like Sheraton Hotel, Lijiang Waterfall Hotel, Eva Inn,  Bravo Hotel, Aroma Tea House, Osmanthus Hotel and etc.) and then the ones  at the eastern part of the city (like Plaza Hotel, Royal Garden Hotel and  etc.).
						</p><p>
							<strong>Note:</strong> Those travelers who stay in another than the three above-mentioned parts of the city, will get a pick-up note at the hotel one day beforehand.
						</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="Pick up Map" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/guilin/pick-up-map.jpg"></div><div class="infoimage"><img alt="Mini Van" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/guilin/biz-car.jpg"></div><div class="tourDates">
							08:45AM: Start off to Longsheng
						</div><p>
							From Guilin to Longsheng we will drive about  2 hours (100km). We will stop 10 minutes for a small break.
						</p><p>
							Many villages are scattered along the way and most of them are now becoming more modern, with vast fruit plantations and rice paddies. Your English-speaking driver will introduce these developments and how they change people’s lives here.
						</p><p>
							<strong>Note:</strong> It might get a little bumpy on the curvy mountain roads.
						</p><div class="tourDates">
							11:00AM – 12:00PM: Visiting Huangluo Yao Village
						</div><p>
							According to the Yao people’s beliefs, when a house is built by the river or mountain-side, the house will provide fortune and happiness to the family. That is why you will see a lot of half-timbered houses by the mountain slopes as the car enters Huangluo Yao village via a hanging bridge, connecting the highway with the village.
						</p><p>
							It is also a Yao custom for the girls to keep long hair. On their 12th birthday, Yao girls begin growing long hair and treating it with secret ingredients made of  rice water and medical herbs.
						</p><p>
							At the present you can find about 120  females at the village, and more than 60% have the really long hair, usually more  than 1.4 meters long. You can see how they brush, wash, braid and coil it up in  their unique and special way.
						</p><p>
							<strong>Note:</strong> The arriving time will be either earlier or later, depending on the weather and road condition.

							12:00PM- 01:00PM: The Lunch time
						</div><p>
							Can you imagine that you can cook your local food and rice in bamboo? Yes, the local staff use bamboo tubes, filling them with raw rice and cooking it on a slow fire. That way we give the rice enough time to absorb the bamboo ingredients and fragrance. Enjoy real local food for lunch while your driver tells you the secrets how to make it delicious.
						</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="Bamboo cooked rice" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/guilin/bamboo-food.jpg"></div><div class="tourDates">
							01:30PM: Exploring Ping’an Village
						</div><p>
							After lunch, your driver will transfer you to Ping'an Village to see the fantanstic rice terraces.
						</p><p>
							Ping’an Village, home to the Zhuang people, was closed to the outside world due to the bad road conditions until 1997. Remarkable traditions and outlooks are preserved even though the majority of the local villagers have picked up second careers as restaurant staff, hostel or café owner, luggage porter or sedan chair carrier. This is probably a brilliant way to make a better living during slack farming season. At harvest, they will be busy harvesting crops in the fields, becoming a part of the scenery.
						</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="Pingan Village" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/guilin/pingan.jpg"></div><div class="tourDates">
							01:30PM-03:30PM: Trekking on Longji Rice Terrace
						</div><p>
							Watering the fields starts in April, planting in June and harvest comes during late September. You can find a special panoramic view from May to September, especially for photograph lovers.
						</p><p>
							<strong>Your driver will transfer you to the top of the village to take a fantastic panoramic view of the terraces and the village. If you would like to walk through the rice terraces, your driver will give you directions so that you can discover the village on your own. The driver will drive down the village and wait for you in the parking lot.</strong> 
						</p><p>
							The construction of Longji Rice Terraces started at the beginning of Yuan Dynasty, which is about 800 years ago. That’s when the Yao minority people migrate to the mountains running away from wars. Then they start to create long planting ranges for rice and transform the mountain into fertile fields, appearing multiple field levels used for creating an irrigation system and water storage areas.
