          <h2 class="noteIcon"><a id="tripnotes"></a>Trip Notes </h2>

     <h3>1. Best time to do the hiking </h3>
     <p>May to October is the best period to hike among the terraced fields. Avoid Guilin’s monsoon (March and April). </p>
<h3>2. What to see </h3>
     <p>Watering the fields starts every April, planting in June and harvest comes during late September. You could find a special panoramic view from May to September, especially for photograph lovers. Your tour guide will gladly lead you to the best spots with panoramic view. </p>
<p>Golden terraced fields are fabulous during China’s National Day holiday. Although we don’t recommend visiting China during the period, yet it’s the best time to see and photograph the countless yellow rice terraces. The rice stalks don’t turn golden before National Day and is quickly cut after the holiday. Rice in Dazhai Village is cut later than Ping’an Village area.</p>
<h3>3. What to pack </h3>
