						Trip Notes
					</h2><h3>
						1. Panda Keeper Program
					</h3><p>
						As the first tour company in China to operate the program, China Highlights has developed stable relationship with the Dujiangyan Panda Base. Sometimes the program is subject to change due to force majeure. Usually we are able to get the first-hand information that is very helpful for your tour arrangement. Your early booking (at least two weeks before departure) is also useful to guarantee the availability of the program. Sometimes the activities listed in the description will be adjusted according to health condition of the pandas. Hope customers can understand this.
					</p><p>
						If your time is limited, you can only join the activities in the morning. The price is the same.
					</p><h3>
						2. Taking Photos with Panda
					</h3><p>
						It costs as much as CNY100,000 (US$16,260) to raise one panda each month. A donation program that allows you to take pictures with a panda next to you for about one minute is not included in the Panda Keeper Program. It is only available in Dujiangyan Panda Base and the donation amount is CNY1,800 per person [July 2015].
					</p><p>
						Only 30 tourists are allowed to take close-up photos with pandas each day. If you would like to take part in this donation program, please tell your travel advisor in advance because we have to book it at least one week in advance. This program is subject to the availability of pandas on that day. Please take enough CNY cash, as payment by a non-Chinese credit card is not accepted there.
					</p><p>
						Please note the <strong>photo program is totally depends on the availability of the pandas on that day</strong>. We will double check on the booking one day in advance and inform you as soon as there is any unexpected change.
