It is also possible to take a boat trip on the lake, which takes 10 minutes.</p><p>You will have lunch at <strong>Chong Xue Villa Restaurant</strong>. As a part of Chong Xue Villa, the restaurant has a wonderful environment with ancient Chinese architecture and a garden. It mainly offers Cantonese cuisine. Only 10 minutes’ walk from the Summer Palace, the restaurant is a good choice for taking a break after walking around the spacious palace.</p><p><strong>Visit the Exteriors of Beijing’s Olympic Stadiums (Bird's Nest and Water Cube) (1 hour) </strong>: Located at the north end of the central axis of Beijing City, with a large area of 1,215 hectares, <strong>Beijing Olympic Park</strong> contains the National Museum of China, an exhibition area, the Olympic Village, and Olympic competition venues.</p><p>Approximately 31 venues were used in the Beijing Olympics, including the National Stadium (also known as the Bird's Nest) and the National Aquatics Center (also known as the Water Cube).

This "city within a city" is a <strong>World Heritage Site</strong>.</p><p>It is the<strong> largest and best preserved</strong> ancient imperial architectural complex in the world, featuring a great square, halls, and gates, which stand in contrast to intricate halls, gardens, courtyards, and quarters. The exhibitions, both permanent and temporary, are all important treasures of ancient China.</p><p><strong>Hutong Tour in Dongcheng District: </strong>The hutongs are<strong> a maze of historic alleyways </strong>with old single story traditional courtyard houses, which are now fast disappearing. In this 1 hour tour, you can walk through the narrow alleys as well as visit a local family and find out about the different thresholds of the courtyards.</p><div class="infoimage"><img alt="Forbidden City" class="img-responsive " src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tianjin-port/forbiddencity.jpg"></div><div class="tourDates"><span class="tourDays">Day 3</span>Temple of Heaven, the Great Wall at Mutianyu (with Round-Trip Cable Car)</div><p><strong>Meals provided:</strong> breakfast, Chinese lunch at Xin Shuang Quan Restaurant</p><p><strong> Hotel: </strong>Novotel Peace Hotel Beijing (4-star) / Crowne Plaza Beijing Chaoyang U-Town (TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence, 5-star)</p><p><strong>The Temple of Heaven (1½ hours): </strong>Built in 1420 during the Ming Dynasty, the Temple of Heaven covers an area of 273 hectares. The Temple of Heaven was enrolled as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998.</p><p><strong>The Hall of Abstinence</strong> is, fittingly, a small palace. The emperor would abstain from consuming meat and wine at the palace before he held the annual ceremony to pray for a good harvest. Three days before the ceremony, the emperor would go to the palace and would not permit himself to drink, be entertained, to mourn, or to pay attention to any crimes being committed. All of these acts showed his piousness to “Heaven”.</p><p>You will also get a chance to see the pictures of all the emperors who ever worshipped in the Temple of Heaven, as well as a <strong>600-year-old copper statue</strong> of a high ranking official who supervised the fasting process of the emperor.</p><p><strong>Xin Shuang Quan Restaurant</strong> is near the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall. This <strong>garden style restaurant</strong> serves farmhouse dishes, specializing in rainbow trout. The fabulous taste will leave you with great memories.</p><p><strong>The Great Wall at Mutianyu (with Round-Trip Cable Car) (2 hours):</strong> <strong>This section is ranked as top</strong> among all the sections of the Great Wall on TripAdvisor due to its picturesque scenery, fewer tourists, and beautifully restored architecture.</p><p>In order to save your time, you will use<strong> round-trip cable car</strong> rides to ascend and descend the Great Wall, instead of spending about 40 minutes climbing the steps.</p><p>Your guide will be with you to hike “<strong>the most beautiful and interesting part of the Great Wall</strong>” – between the 14th and 23rd watchtowers – acknowledged by hikers as “the golden route”.</p><p>The cable car and transfer bus rides to and from your vehicle are included in the price.</p><p><strong>Good to know:</strong></p><ul class="drop1 infolist">
	<li>We avoid (the worst of the) crowds on the Great Wall and traffic jams by visiting in the afternoon. It’s also the best time for taking good photos.</li>
	<li>China Highlights has set up a Refreshments Kiosk at the foot of Mutianyu’s Great Wall section. China Highlights customers will receive free drinking water, beers, and maps at the service site.</li>
