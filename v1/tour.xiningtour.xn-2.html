                </div><p>Pick up from the airport and check-in with a help to you guide. The rest of the day is free for your own arrangement and to prepare for the bike tour tomorrow.</p><div class="tourDates">
                  <span class="tourDays">Day 2</span>Xining to Huangyuan Biking (4 hours biking)
                </div><div class="infoimage"><img alt="" class="img-responsive " src="https://data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/biking/qinghai-lake-tour(5).jpg"></div><p>Commence the first leg of this biking tour from Xining to Huangyuan County. The ride is 70 km long and lasts for about 4 hours. Pass through Duoba County which is a Tibetan county, and then continue riding tour to Huangyuan County passing through Huangyuan Canyon.</p><p><strong>Trip Note:</strong> Restaurant choices and conditions along the trip are very limited, but we will arrange meals at the best possible restaurants to ensure you have a taste of real local food..</p><div class="tourDates">
                  <span class="tourDays">Day 3</span>Huangyuan to Qinghai Lake Biking (7 hours biking)
                </div><div class="infoimage"><img alt="" class="img-responsive " src="https://data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/biking/qinghai-lake-tour(6).jpg"></div><p>Today’s ride is 120 km long for about 7 hours. Start with a long moderate hill climb on the state road to Qinghai Lake. You will have probably gotten used to breathing in the high plateau air! From here the Dao Tang River (means reverse flowing river) is visible. The river flows from east to west, which is rare because the general geological pattern in China is higher in the west and gradually descends towards the east. Depending on how you feel after the climb, continue on the flat at the south eastern corner of Qinghai Lake and enjoy the sunset.</p><p>Qinghai Lake is China's largest inland salt water lake. The ellipse-shaped lake looks like a huge poplar leaf sitting on the alpine prairie. Scenery in Qinghai Lake varies according to seasons. Summer and autumn are the most comfortable weather conditions and the lake's scenery is most beautiful during these seasons.</p><div class="tourDates">
                  <span class="tourDays">Day 4</span>Qinghai Lake to Heimahe Biking (7 hours biking)

The morning’s ride will first follow the busy national road. In June and July, the wild rapeseed flowers are in bloom, blanketing the landscape with shades of yellow and gold. There is little civilization around most of the lake, so we will stop in a quiet spot along the way for a picnic lunch to recharge our energy with some snacks and fruits.</p><p>The route in the afternoon will lead us away from the traffic onto quiet roads alongside the lake. We will cycle in an area of peaceful tranquility until we reach our overnight stop in Hemahe County. It is a small town located at the intersection of the road to Bird Island and Saltwater Lake at Chaka. Tonight we will camp near the village.</p><div class="tourDates">

On the way you will probably come across a few young curious but friendly Tibetan lamas. Those who wish can climb up a small mountain with a Tibetan style tower made of rocks and tree branches on top, to get a fascinating bird’s view of the crops, the winding road leading to Bird Island and Qinghai Lake in the distance.</p><p>Between May and July, around 100,000 migratory birds - Red-Crowned cranes and King Shags migrate from South East Asia to Bird Island to breed, and literally cover the whole island. Tourists can get a close up view of these birds from within the well hidden observatory during the birds' breeding season.</p><div class="tourDates">
