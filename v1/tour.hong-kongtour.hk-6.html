              <h3>1. About the Booking</h3>
              <p>Confirmation will be received within <strong>one working day</strong>, unless booked within 5 days of travel. In this case, confirmation will be received within two working days, subject to availability.</p>
              <h3>2. Proof of Age</h3>
              <p>Proof of age will be requested from all guests prior to admission into the park.</p>
              <h3>3. Special Notes for a Seat-in-a-Coach Tour</h3>
              <p>1) A seat-in-coach tour minimizes costs because expenses are shared among a larger group.</p>
              <p>2) Seat-in-coach tours are operated by local business partners of China Highlights around China. China Highlights chooses business partners by strict quality standards. The service of a seat-in-coach tour may not always be as considerate as that of a private tour.</p>
              <p>3) Visiting one or two shops or markets is always included in a seat-in-coach tour, but there is no pressure to buy if you are not interested. Usually it takes 30-40 minutes, depending on the preference of most of the group members.</p>
              <p>4) A seat-in-coach tour usually consists of more than five people. You will have a local guide and use a 24-or-45-seat air-conditioned coach. We will pick you up at some appointed hotels at an appointed time. In contrast, a private tour provides a private car and guide, and we will pick you up at your hotel.</p>
              <h3>4. Cancellation Policy</h3>
              <p>If we are not able to implement the contract due to war, flood, typhoon, fire, strikes, storm, earthquake, or any other condition we are not able to foresee and avoid, we will inform you at the first possible opportunity and offer the best possible solutions, and the final bill shall be settled based on the service we actually provide.</p>
              <p><strong>Up to 7 days before departure:</strong> 100% refund of all monies paid, excluding penalties charged by hotels, railways, airlines, and PayPal, if applicable. All penalties will be itemized.<br>
              <strong>From 3 to 7 days before departure:</strong> 90% refund, excluding penalties charged by hotels, railways, airlines, and PayPal, if applicable. All penalties will be itemized.<br>
              <strong>Within 3 days before departure:</strong> no refund.<br>
              After the trip has commenced, we are unable to refund any amount for cancelled services due to non-participation, early departure, late arrival, or missed days on tours.</p>
