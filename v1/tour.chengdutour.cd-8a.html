            </div><a name="itinerary" id="itinerary"></a><h2>Suggested Itinerary</h2><a id="tripnotes"></a><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>1. Can I have a private car in Leshan? I don't want to take a taxi or the high-speed train.</h3><p>Since Leshan is a small developing city, there is no decent travel agency offering private transfer serivce. For you to enjoy private transfer in Leshan, we are happy to arrange a private car and a driver to escort you between Chengdu and Leshan. It will make the tour more worried-free but more pricy, as the distance is over 142 kilometers (88 miles) and it takes about two hours each way. The tour cost is approximately US$50–80 higher per person. Please inform our trip advisor of your preference.</p><h3>2. Can I take a cruise to have an overlook at the Leshan Buddha?</h3><p>Due to the limited time, there won't be enough time for both climbing the Buddha and taking a cruise. The cruise lasts for about 20 minutes but it may take some time to queue. You can choose either to climb or to take the cruise.</p><h3>3. What if we cannot catch the train going back to Chengdu?</h3><p>We will purchase the round-trip tickets for you in advance and your guide will forward them to you during the tour. If you miss the booked train going back to Chengdu, your guide can help you change to a later train at the train station without extra cost.</p><h3>4. What information is required to book the tour?</h3><p>Clear passport copy is required to purchase the train tickets for you. Please also inform the name and address of your hotel in downtown Chengdu. It's recommended to book the tour at least 7 days before departure date so that we can purchase the train tickets with the best schedule.</p><h3>5. What are the Payment Methods:</h3><p>We now offer 3 payment methods: PayPal, credit card authorization via fax and wire transfer. PayPal is recommended for its safety and efficiency. You can pay USA dollars, Australian dollars, European dollars and Great Britain Pound directly with your credit card or debit card, even if you don't have PayPal account.</p><h3>6. What is the Cancellation Policy?</h3><p>In the event of cancellation we will refund any payment made to China Highlights (unless any cancellation fee applicable) within 14 days of our receipt of your written cancellation request. Visit <a href="/aboutus/terms.htm">here</a> for more details.</p><h3>7. What about the Gratuities to Guide and Driver?</h3><p>Tips to the guide and driver are not included. If the guide's and driver's service truly satisfy you, our suggestion to the tips would be:<br>
                1 person in the group, CNY150-200,<br>
                2 people in a group: CNY100/person,<br>
                3-5 people in a group: CNY50-70/person,<br>
                6-9 people in a group: CNY40-50/person,<br>
                ≥10 people in a group: CNY20-30/person.<br>
                The driver would be half the amount, and separate offer to each is best.</p><h3>8. Do I Need Travel Insurance?</h3><p>Travel insurance is not included. We carefully selected some insurance providers from your region that give you the best value for money. Click <a href="/travelguide/insurance/">here</a> to go to the travel insurance page.</p>
