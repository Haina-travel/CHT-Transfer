                  <span class="tourDays">Day 1</span>Arrive in Beijing
                </div><p>Your vacation couldn’t have a better start than your own guide and driver meeting you at the airport and take you to your hotel.</p><div class="tourDates">
                  <span class="tourDays">Day 2</span>Temple of Heaven, Great Wall and Peking Duck
                </div><p>We take you to the less visited section of the Great Wall, Mutianyu, which is a less touristy part. A cable car takes you up to make sure you make the most of trekking where the views are best over the watchtowers in the distance. An option for coming down is the toboggan run, although sometimes it is so popular that the waiting time cab be too long.</p><p>The Temple of Heaven has a collection of buildings used by the Emperor once a year to make a sacrifice for good harvest. The structures form a line on a South to North axis, which was considered very lucky. The surrounding park has become the place where locals come to exercise and practice their hobbies, be it singing, kungfu or flying a kite.</p><p>In the evening your guide will take you to experience that famous delicacy of Beijing: Roast Peking Duck.</p><div class="dayTourList">
                  <div class="tourDates">
                    <span class="tourDays">Day 3</span>Beijing: Historical Sights
                  </div>
                  <p>Tiananmen Square is a symbol of China’s national pride, where a flag raise each morning gathers asizablecrowd; at times you have to arrive by 4am for the 7am event. Our day startslater than that, visiting Tiananmen Square, from which you can see Chairman Mao’s mausoleum and National Museum as well as the Great Hall of the People, each standing imposingly around the square.</p>
                  <p>Directly from the square you will access the Forbidden City or Palace Museum as it is now also called. The size makes it more of a small town instead of a palace; one visit is never enough to see everything. Many buildings have been renovated, and even more wings opened to the public. The architecture is steeped in symbolism; your guide will tell you more.</p>
                  <p>Hutongs are an essential part of Beijing life, and the best way to tour the winding alleyways is by a rickshaw. Your guide will also take you to meet a local family, who has for generations lived in the same house. Afterwards you can walk along the charming Silver Ingot Bridge and find out all the information you can get just from a closed gate to a hutong dwelling.</p>
                  <p>The area is near some great shopping streets, so you may wish to stay there on your own, just tell your guide.</p>
                  <p>Good to Know</p>
                  <p>There is a famous acrobatic Kongfu show in Beijing, ask for more details.</p>
                </div><div class="dayTourList">

                    <span class="tourDays">Day 4</span>Summer Palace and Fly to Xian
                  </div>
                  <p>There is perhaps no better way to explore Yangshuo’s countryside, than by bike or eCart. After experiencing the bustle of local traffic you will soon be in Yangshuo’s rural countryside roads and lanes. It is not only the scenery that captivates but people and culture all around you.</p>
                  <p>This morning is dedicated to visiting the Summer Palace, a haven of the emperors and now a popular place for locals to relax. The extensive gardens and the lake are just as much part of the allure as are the pavilions and towers; make sure you spend some time meandering among the willows.</p>
                  <p>On the way back to the hotel a stop at the Olympic Park area allows you to see up close the impressive Bird’s Nest and Water Cube, although time does not allow for an internal visit. After lunch you are taken to your hotel to prepare for your flight to Xi’an. Your guide will take you to take care of everything.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>One of the most memorable experiences in China is to see the Terracotta Army. Still standing in place of their original discovery, standing firm after over 2000 years underground. Discoveries are still made; some new soldiers which still show the painted effects have recently been put on display. Don’t miss the film about the discovery process.</p>
                  <p>The elegant Big Wild Goose Pagoda is a landmark in Xi’an, and stands on the grounds of Da Cien Temple, located in a large garden.</p>
                  <p>Good to Know:</p>
                  <p>Qujiangchi Park near the pagoda is a great place for a stroll after dinner; the buildings around the lake are lit charmingly.</p>
