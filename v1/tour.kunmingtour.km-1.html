                </div><p>Your private guide will pick you up outside the luggage claim area and transfer you to your hotel in a professionally-chauffeured vehicle. The rest of the day is for you to acclimatize and explore the city, or relax and recoup ready for the tour tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Good to know:</strong><br>
                If you arrive early in the morning and have some time to kill, you may consider enriching your day by visiting <strong>Yunnan Minority Village</strong>, which gives a very quick view of the various minorities in Yunnan and their cultures, costumes, and customs. If you are interested in the history of the American Flying Tigers during World War II, <strong>Kunming Museum</strong> is recommended.</p><p><strong>Accommodation</strong><br>

                <span class="tourDays">Day 2</span>Stone Forest and Yuantong Temple Tour
              </div><p>After a 1½-hour drive, visit a fantastic natural phenomenon located 90 kilometers southeast of Kunming — the <strong>Stone Forest</strong>. The various shapes of limestone were formed due to millions of years' movement of the Earth. The Stone Forest area is the home of the Naxi people, and their folk customs have become a spectacular scene.

Enjoy a local <strong>lunch</strong> in a quaint courtyard with the Stone Forest Park in the background.</p><p>In the afternoon, transfer back to Kunming and visit the <strong>Yuantong Temple</strong>, the largest and most ancient Buddhist temple in Kunming, to learn about the differences between the halls of the three denominations of Buddhism.</p><p>After the tour, your guide and driver will escort you back to your hotel for a good rest.</p><p><strong>Good to know:</strong><br>
              For Chinese tourists, the Stone Forest Park is a must-see attraction; therefore, the countless tourist groups there during the peak season rank among travelers’ pet peeves. Due to the gigantic size of the park, your guide will help you find quieter, more remote areas to avoid the crowds, especially in the winter months.</p><img class="img-responsive img-rounded marginTop15" name="" src="https://data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/yunnan/naigu11.jpg" alt="Stone Forest and Yuantong Temple" width="100%"><div class="tourDates">

You will have a bird’s-eye view of the Dianchi Lake and appreciate the groups of Taoist sculptures in the grottoes on the cliff in this scenic area.</p><p>After lunch in a traditional style restaurant, visit the <strong>Jingxing Bird and Flower Market</strong>, a building focusing on flowers and pets such as gold fish, birds, and a wide array of knick-knacks. The market retains the feel of a traditional Chinese market and it’s a nice place to experience local life.</p><p>Sit back and relax as your guide will already have called to confirm your next journey.
