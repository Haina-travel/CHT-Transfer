                  <h2 class="noteIcon"><a id="tripnotes"></a>Trip Notes</h2>
                  <h3>1. Tailoring Your Tour</h3>
                  <p>This tour is very flexible. You can alter the itinerary, extend or shorten it to suit your price, interest, and schedule. If you would like to book the hotels on your own, we can remove the hotel cost from quotation. Please inform your travel advisor about your preference.</p>
                  <h3>2. Get close to pandas</h3>
                  <p>In order to protect the giant pandas from canine distemper infection, <strong>The Panda Breeding and Research Center</strong> has stopped all the panda interconnect activities since January, 2015.</p>
                  <p>If you want to get close to the pandas and do something for them, you can visit the <strong>Dujiangyan Panda Base</strong> (90-minute's drive from Chengdu). The Panda Keeper Program and taking photo with pandas is <strong>only available there now</strong>. The program can last for one to three days and the activities may include feeding the pandas, making panda cakes and cleaning the panda enclosures. You can visit <a href="/tour/chengdutour/cd-7a/">here</a> to book 1-Day Chengdu to Dujiangyan Panda Keeper Program Tour.</p>
                  <p>Feel free to tell us your requirements and interests, and we will be happy to help you arrange a trip using our professional knowledge and experience.</p>
                  <h3>3. Mount Qingcheng</h3>
                  <p>Mount Qingcheng consists of two parts: Front Mountain and Back Mountain.<br>
                  <strong>Front Mountain:</strong> The view of this part is very close to sceneries in the movie <em>Kung Fu Panda 3</em> and the Taoist temples of Front Mountains are big and famous. Some stairs are narrow and steep. You can take a boat across Yuecheng Lake and take the Buyun Cable Car to keep the tour relaxing. After getting off the cable car, 1-1½ hour walking on the steep stairs is required. Without cable car, at least 3 hours are requried.<br>
                  <strong>Back Mountain:</strong> This part is quieter and the Taoist temples are smaller and scattered in the deep forest. It's a great place to appreciate natural beauty and breath fresh, but the stairs of this part are lack of maintainess. Two cable cars are available at hillside and on the mountain top, but taking cable car may miss the most beautiful parts of the mountain. Without cable car, it takes about 3.5 hours to climb up and down the mountain.</p>
                  <h3>4. Payment Methods:</h3>
                  <p>We now offer 3 payment methods: PayPal, credit card authorization via fax and wire transfer. PayPal is recommended for its safety and efficiency.

                  <h3>6. Gratuities to Guide or Driver</h3>
                  <p>Tips to the guide and driver are not included. If the guide's and driver's service truly satisfy you, our suggestion to the tips would be:<br>

                  ≥10 people in a group: CNY20-30/person.<br>
                  The driver would be half the amount, and separate offer to each is best.</p>
