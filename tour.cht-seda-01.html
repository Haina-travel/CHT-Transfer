<h2 class="noteIcon"><a id="tripnotes"></a>Trip Notes</h2>

<h3>1. Trip Extension</h3>

<p>Chengdu is the hometown of giant pandas. If you would like to add a Chengdu city tour or take a one day panda keeper program before or after the photo tour, please feel free to ask your travel advisor to add it.</p>

<h3>2. International Flights to Chengdu</h3>

<p>As one of big cities in China, Chengdu has international direct flights to San Francesco, Melbourne, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Round-trip international flights are not included.</p>

<h3>3. Food and Accommodation</h3>

<p>We have selected the <strong>best possible accommodation</strong> in each destination; however, some of them might be basic because they are situated a long way from the cities. The hotels offer a Chinese breakfast, such as congee or noodles.</p>

<p>Local <strong>Sichuan cuisine</strong> restaurants are arranged for lunches and dinners, and the chefs can control the amount of spicy ingredients according to your preferences.</p>

<h3>4. Fitness Level</h3>

<p>It’s possible to experience general fatigue due to the long flights and changes in time zones. You will need to be sufficiently agile in order to climb in and out of the transport vehicle, and be able to carry and manage your own photographic gear and luggage. You will hike along trails and paths ranging from easy to moderate throughout the trip. About four-hours<strong> walking is needed on Day 4-Day 6</strong>. Some hotels may not be equipped with elevators or air-conditioning.</p>

<p>If you have special needs (including a special diet) or any physical condition that you feel might prevent you from fully participating, please make us aware of this when registering for the trip. Please also be aware that medical services and facilities might not be readily available during all or part of the trip.</p>

<p>During the trip, the average altitude is about<strong> 3300km to 3600km from Day 2-Day 6</strong>, you will reach the highest places at an elevation of about <strong>4,200 meters</strong>, so read the information about mountain sickness below.</p>

<h3>5. Mountain Sickness</h3>

<p>Mountain sickness is caused by acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. It commonly occurs above 2,400 meters through different symptoms, such as nausea, lack of appetite, fatigue, insomnia, and shortness of breath. The only way to defeat mountain sickness is by quickly descending.</p>

<p>It is possible to prevent it by acclimating correctly, which is what you are going to do during the tour. However, it varies from person to person and, while many may feel all right, some people might suffer from it. People who have high blood pressure and heart diseases are not suitable for the tour. We recommend that you check with your doctor and ask him for advice about your health status and any medication you should take with you.</p>

<h3>6. Photography Equipment and What to Pack</h3>

<p>Make sure you pack the right equipment. We highly recommend:</p>

<ul class="drop1">
	<li>DSLR camera with tripod and remote shutter release</li>
	<li>Telephoto zoom lens, such as 70–200 mm</li>
	<li>Standard lens, such as 24–70 mm</li>
	<li>Ultra-wide angle lens, such as 14–24 mm or 16–35 mm, depending on the brand of your camera</li>
	<li>Two or more extra batteries and chargers</li>
	<li>Laptop for editing pictures (Lightroom software is recommended)</li>
	<li>Spare CF/SD cards</li>
	<li>Comfortable backpack or bag for your gear</li>
	<li>ND, ND grad, and polarizing filters. Please note during the tour participants will be able to use some of the photographer's filters provided by "LEE Filters"</li>
</ul>

<p>Take warm clothes as the weather can be particularly cold. It might even snow. Remember to pack a scarf, gloves, hat, waterproof jacket, comfortable shoes, and a headlamp with spare batteries. Please contact us with any further questions; we will be happy to help you.</p>

<h3>7. Payment</h3>

<p><strong>Deposit:</strong> a $260 (€226)deposit is required. If you register and then cancel more than 60 days prior to the tour date we will fully refund your deposit. If a cancellation is requested within 60 days, then we will keep your deposit.</p>

<p><strong>Full payment:</strong> The remaining balance is required 30 days before the tour start. If you cancel within 20 days, we will keep half of the amount paid, unless your seat is filled. If your seat gets filled before the event, then we will fully refund your amount minus the deposit.</p>

<p><strong>Cancellation policy:</strong> In the unlikely event we have to cancel the tour, we will offer a full refund.</p>

<h3>8. Insurance</h3>

<p>We strongly urge you to evaluate your risk and to take out travel insurance that covers the full value of the trip and personal effects in case of loss or theft of baggage and an emergency evacuation.</p>

<p>Travel insurance helps to minimize the risk of monetary losses you would incur in the event of a delay of your departure due to weather, an airline strike, missed connection, etc., as well as your inability to travel for reasons such as illness, injury, unforeseen financial complications, and other personal circumstances, or if you were required to cut the trip short for medical purposes or any other reasons.</p>
