                <p>March to April: Yellow rape flowers start to bloom in spring. The mountains are decorated with red azaleas; the hills are covered by green tea plants and golden blooming yellow rape flowers.</p>
                <p>September to October: On the way to the Yellow Mountains, you can see fields filled with golden chrysanthemum. The mountains are dazzled with the changing colors of the plants of the fall season.</p>
                <p>December to March of the following year: The top of the Yellow Mountains will be covered with snow and ice from time to time in winter. The mountains turn into a winter wonderland and it’s the best time to photograph the seas of clouds.</p>
