<h2 class="noteIcon"><a id="tripnotes"></a>Trip Notes</h2>

<h3>1. Tailoring your tour</h3>

<p><strong>This tour is very flexible.</strong> You can alter the itinerary, extend or shorten it to suit your price, interest and schedule. Feel free to tell us your requirements, and we are happy to help you arrange with our professional knowledge and experience.</p>

<h3>2. About Accommodation in the Mount Emei and the Yellow Mountains</h3>

<p>The star-rated hotels in the Mount Emei and the Yellow Mountains might not be up to the standard of those in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Due to the moist weather on the mountains, the rooms are sometimes humid. Despite the lack of choice, the hotels we use in the tour are carefully selected based on criteria like hotel environment, location, service, and previous customer feedback. Your guide will accompany you to check the room. If you are dissatisfied with the room and there are other rooms available, your guide will be happy to assist you with changing it.</p>

<h3>3. About Food in the Yellow Mountains</h3>

<p>In Tunxi and the surrounding villages, you can taste authentic Huizhou cuisine, which is known for its roasting, stewing, braising, and quick-frying. On the mountains, restaurants and cuisine choices are very limited. We will find the best available, but it is also recommended that you purchase some snacks before you start to ascend the mountains. Supplies are available on the mountains but the prices increase with the altitude, as they all need to be carried up by hand.</p>

<h3>4. Reminder</h3>

<p>West Sea Grand Canyon, Celestial Capital Peak, and Lotus Peak usually close from December to March of the following year due to the snowy weather. The guide will adjust the itinerary to cover other highlights to make the most of your time.</p>
