              On our second day of touring, Jenny brought us to an authentic local market. This type of market isn't all that common in the US. Fresh meats, live fish, frogs and other edibles were ready for purchase. My husband and daughter even tried a 4 month old egg. While neither of them liked it, neither spit it out!

              <p>Your guide will call you at your hotel one day in advance or will leave a message to confirm the collection time with you. You will be picked up at around 7am from your hotel. After arrival at the panda base, <strong>sign up and get a uniform</strong>. Your guide will introduce you to the professional panda keepers. The panda keepers can speak simple English but your guide will be there for you at all times, helping to translate and taking memorable photos of you with the lovable pandas.</p>

              <p><strong>Clean the panda enclosures</strong>. Panda keepers need to supply fresh bamboo three times a day. The pandas usually only eat 30% of the bamboo, wasting 70% of it. You will need to sweep out the leftovers and replace them with fresh bamboo, as well as clean out the feces.</p>
