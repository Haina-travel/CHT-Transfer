    <p>Our 2 days visit in Xian was a good, eye-opening learning experience. Our visit comprised of all the top must-see
      attractions. One worthwhile thing to do is to see Xian in the night when many buildings and streets are lit up.
      For e g, the streets and pedestrian walkway near the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. It's our regret we only saw a small
      portion as we didn't know the night views beforehand. Xian was our second stop on our travel schedule, also our
      favorite destination amongst 6 other cities. Wished we had 3 days in Xian. - 7Makarios from the USA<a

      <p>There’s no need to get up too early so visit <strong>the Summer Palace</strong> in the late morning, have
        lunch, and then drive to Jinshanling, which is <strong>the best place</strong> to enjoy a sunset from the Great
        Wall in summer, the best season.</p>

      <p>Arrive there at about 3:30pm to avoid the hottest time of day and ensure there are no crowds around you.
        Jinshanling is an <strong>unrepaired and quite well-preserved section</strong> of the Great Wall. As time goes
        by, the view gradually changes. You’ll see golden sunlight and green trees at the beginning, then the glow from
        the sunset dyes the sky purple and the moon rises slowly in the distance. The Great Wall is just like a huge
        dragon that has fallen asleep quietly.</p>

        lifetime!</p>

      <p>You have a whole day in Longsheng - a place where you can enjoy traditional agriculture and minority cultures.
      </p>

      <p>Layers of green <strong>terraced rice fields</strong> are covered in white rice flowers, which are very tiny
        even though they are in full bloom. Under robust rice shoots, there are lots of creatures - little carps! Local
        people keep these fish from fries, and the fish eat microbes and rice flowers in the fields. By swimming in the
        fields, the fish loosen the soil for the rice and their waste is a natural fertilizer. What a magic ecosystem
        created by the local people's wisdom! Roll up your trouser legs, carry a bamboo basket, and step into the muddy
        field to have <strong>a fish-catching competition</strong>.</p>

      <p>Have lunch with a family from the Zhuang minority, learn how to <strong>make bamboo rice, or try their
          refreshing oil tea.</strong></p>
