<p>Today you will spend a day and a night on <strong>the Yellow Mountains</strong>. It takes about one hour from central Huangshan City to reach the foot of the Yellow Mountains. Your appreciation of the graceful Yellow Mountains begins with the Yungu cable car (a round-trip cable car is included). Don't miss the magnificent scenery along your 10-minute journey.</p>

<p>Your guide, who spends over 200 days on the mountains every year, will customize the route for you.</p>

<p><strong>For an energetic hiker in good shape:</strong> Descend the cable car, walk for about 30 minutes via mostly down stairs to arrive at the hotel, and see Umbrella Pine and Black Tiger Pine along the way. After buffet lunch at the hotel, explore the West Sea Grand Canyon. The whole hiking trip lasts for over three hours, covering the 1st ring, 2nd ring, and bottom of the canyon. If time and strength permit, you can further explore the Flying-over Rock and watch the sunset at Bright Top. It takes about 40 minutes to get from Bright Top back to the hotel.</p>

<p><strong>For beginners, children, and senior citizens:</strong> Get off the cable car, walk for about 30 minutes to the hotel, and see Black Tiger Pine and Dream Flower Pine on the way. After buffet lunch at the hotel, walk to West Sea Grand Canyon. You can decide how long you would like to walk for: reaching the 1st ring and returning takes about two hours; reaching the 2nd ring and returning takes about 2½ hours. Then enjoy the sunset at Cloud-dispelling Pavilion. It takes about 30 minutes to get back to the hotel.</p>

<div class="GoodtoKnow">
<h3>Good to know:</h3>

<p><strong>Travel light!</strong> Please take a small bag or backpack for your overnight stay on the mountain. Your guide will assist you with storing your big suitcase in your hotel in Tunxi. You can collect it on your way back. You can also store the luggage at the foot of the mountain. The cost is about CNY20 (US$4) for each piece.</p>

<p><strong>Short Cut.</strong> From the Cloud-dispelling Pavilion to the button of West Sea Crand Canyon, it's down stairs all the way and some sections are very narrow and steep. Therefore, trekking in the West Sea Grand Canyon can be a big challenge, especially to your knees. A monorail is available to help you save time and strength. It runs between the bottom of the Canyon and the main peak area, which is about 300 meters (0.2 miles) from the Baiyun Hotel. The 893 meters (0.6 miles) takes less than five minutes and the cost is CNY80 (US$13) per person.</p>
