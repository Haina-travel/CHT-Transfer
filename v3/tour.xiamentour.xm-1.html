    This 3-day tour combines the essential attractions in Xiamen with the World Heritage Site â€” the Fujian Tulou. We have selected three tulou clusters, which are the essence of the Fujian Tulou and help you avoid the commercial sites and tourist crowds. In this way, you can experience the authentic lifestyle and culture of the Hakka and Minnan people. You can not only appreciate the unique architecture but also feel the spirit of the Hakka people condensed in the buildings.

              <p><strong>Tianluokeng Tulou Cluster</strong></p>
              <p>Tianluokeng Tulou Cluster will be the first attraction you visit. It is composed of four round earthen buildings and a square one. It is one of the most magnificent and well-preserved Hakka fortresses.

              <p><strong>Yuchang Earthen Building</strong></p>
              <p>Yuchang Earthen Building is a skewed building. It is one of the oldest existing tulou. This five-story earth building is most famous for its tilted pillars. The most extreme one is slanted at a 15-degree angle. There are five highlights in this building for you to discover. Let your guide uncover its secrets for you.

              <p>Hekeng Tulou Cluster</p>
              <p>Hekeng Tulou Cluster is one of the six tulou clusters belonging to the World Heritage Site, the Fujian Tulou. It is an authentic and less touristy Hakka village full of earthen buildings in different shapes. It is Mulan's "hometown" in the movie Mulan. You will see the real earthen building where Mulan is depicted as living in the movie. The Hakka people are happy to invite you into the living room of their earthen building and show you the upstairs floor. This might not be available in other tulou clusters. Have a cup of local tea and listen to the stories about their families. It is a great chance to get close to the Hakka people's lifestyle and culture.

                <p>Taxia Village and Tea Plantation Experience</p>
                <p>Taxia Village is a distinctive Hakka village located in a valley in Nanjing County. It was built by the Zhang family about 600 years ago and many famous overseas Chinese people can trace their history back to this village. From April to November, you can pick tea leaves at a local tea plantation just like a local Hakka tea farmer and learn to process the tea leaves. You can take the tea you make back home with you. You can also taste some black tea that has already been prepared by the local farmers.
