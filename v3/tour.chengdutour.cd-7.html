<p>We were heading to People's Park when she suggested we made a stop at local market to see local produce. The Peoples park was a buzzing place with much activity and we enjoyed tea in the oldest tea house in chengdu while chatting to Daisy about China life and she was very interested in our culture too. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297463-d7998265-r674695294-China_Highlights_Chengdu-Chengdu_Sichuan.html" target="_top">Read more</a></p>

          <p>Located 60 kilometers or 1½ hours away from Chengdu by car, Dujiangyan Panda Base is <strong>the most easily accessible base in China</strong> to join the Panda Keeper Program.</p>
          <div class="onedayroute">

            <div class="onedayinfo">
              <p>Your guide will call you at your hotel one day in advance or will leave a message to confirm the collection time with you. You will be picked up at around 7am from your hotel. After arrival at the panda base, <strong>sign up and get a uniform</strong>. Your guide will introduce you to the professional panda keepers. The panda keepers can speak simple English but your guide will be there for you at all times, helping to translate and taking memorable photos of you with the lovable pandas.</p>

You will need to sweep out the leftovers and replace them with fresh bamboo, as well as clean out the feces.</p>

          <h2>Trip Notes</h2>
          <h3>1. Booking Panda Keeper Program</h3>
          <p>As the first tour company in China to operate the program, China Highlights has developed stable relationship with the Dujiangyan Panda Base. Sometimes the program is subject to change due to force majeure. Usually we are able to get the first-hand information that is very helpful for your tour arrangement. Your early booking is also useful to guarantee the availability of the program. Sometimes the activities listed in the description will be adjusted according to health condition of the pandas. Hope customers can understand this.<br>
          If your time is limited, you can only join the activities in the morning. The price is the same.</p>
          <p>This tour is very flexible. You can alter the itinerary, and extend or shorten it to suit your schedule.</p>
          <p>Physical Examination Record is required for panda keeper program application. Please click the link below to download the form. Feel free to contact our 1:1 travel expert for any questions.</p><span class="GuilinPDF"><a href="https://data.chinahighlights.com/image/pdf/Physical-Examination-Record-Panda-Keeper-Program.pdf" target="_blank">Download the PDF</a></span>
          <h3>2. Age Limit</h3>
          <p>The age restriction of volunteer is between <strong>10 to 70 years old</strong>. Even though the pandas look harmless, they are carnivores. Parents must ensure that they prevent their children from coming into direct contact with the pandas. The cost for children of 10 years old and above is the same as the cost for adults. If your children are <strong>between 0–9 years old</strong>, you can still take them with you during the program. The children can not enter the room where the panda cage is. Your guide can help take care of them if you like.</p>
          <h3>3. Dress Code</h3>
          <p>Certain pavements in the base can be very <strong>wet and slippery</strong>. To avoid slipping, please do not wear short pants or slippery footwear. Also, pandas have a very keen sense of smell. As you will get very close to them during the tour, please do not wear perfume or nail polish. Our sincere thanks for your extra care and respect towards the pandas.</p>
          <h3>4. Transportation Suggestions</h3>
          <p>If you need to catch a flight or train after the program, flights departing after 8 pm or trains departing after 7 pm are recommended. For international flights, flights after 9 pm are suggested. If your flight or train leaves earlier than the recommended times above, you may need to skip some arrangements in the afternoon and head earlier to the airport or train station.</p>
