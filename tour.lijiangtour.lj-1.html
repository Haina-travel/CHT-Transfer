<h2>Trip Notes</h2><h3>1. Tailoring Your Tour</h3><p><strong>This tour is very flexible</strong>. You can alter the itinerary, and extend or shorten it to suit your price, interest, and schedule. Feel free to tell us your requirements, and we will be happy to help you arrange a tour using our professional knowledge and experience. We promise a <strong>"No Shopping Policy"</strong>.</p><p>Lijiang Ancient Town attracts more tourists than the Forbidden City in Beijing during peak season. Here are some tips to escape the hordes of tourists:<br>
1. Stay overnight in Lijiang Ancient Town and start early: 80% of the tourists will be in 20% of the places. Get up early and find the best spots with the help of your guide.<br>
2. Stay overnight in Shuhe Ancient Town: 20-minutes away from Lijiang by car, Shuhe ancient town is less touristic and quieter.</p><h3>2. Optional Extension:</h3><p><strong>Tiger Leaping Gorge</strong><br>
As one of the deepest and most marvelous gorges, Tiger Leaping Gorge is about two hours away from Lijiang by car. It is a paradise for hiking enthusiasts. You can extend the tour by one day to visit the upper gorge, or extend it by 2–3 days to hike through the whole gorge.</p><p><strong>Lugu Lake</strong><br>
The lake area is best known as home to the unique Mosuo culture. The Mosuo, a subgroup of the Naxi, is a matrilineal society whose members engage in traditional "walking marriages", in which the husband and wife remain in their respective maternal homes and often have more than one partner. The picturesque scenery there is also impressive. The drive from Lijiang takes over six hours and 3–5 days are required to extend the tour.</p><h3>3. Getting There and Traveling Away</h3><p>There are over 20 flights between Lijiang and Kunming every day. There are also flights connecting Lijiang with <strong>Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou</strong>,and <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, with a stopover in Kunming.</p><h3>4. Hotel</h3><p>Hotel with a convenient location, regional features and good reviews are recommended in the itinerary. If you prefer other hotel options (luxuty hotels, boutique hotels, or economical choices) or would like to book the hotels on your own, please feel free to inform us and we will be happy to adjust the details.
