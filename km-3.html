      <p>After a 1½-hour drive, visit a fantastic natural phenomenon located 90 kilometers southeast of Kunming — the Stone Forest. The various shapes of limestone were formed due to millions of years' movement of the Earth. The Stone Forest area is the
        home of the Naxi people, and their folk customs have become a spectacular scene. The colorful embroidery and minority dances combined with the natural scenery will surely leave you with a lasting impression. Enjoy a local lunch in a quaint courtyard
        with the Stone Forest Park in the background.</p>

      <p><img alt="Stone Forest" class="img-responsive" src="//data.chinahighlights.com/image/tour-detail/yunnan/km-3-day-2-stone-forest.jpg" /> Stone Forest</p>

      <p>In the …erse yourself in the breathtaking natural beauty and holy religious atmosphere of the unspoiled Shangri-La. Visit the largest Tibetan Buddhist Lamasery in Yunnan Province — Songzanlin Lamasery — which was built in the style of Potala Palace
        in Lhasa and represents the Tibetan culture, housing Buddhist statues and many precious cultural treasures.</p>

      <p>After visiting the lamasery, your guide will take you to a dormitory. The lamas who live there will show their hospitality and will be happy to talk with you in their study room. If you are curious about their lifestyle, religious beliefs, and discipline,
        this is a great chance to get close to and interact with them. If you are lucky, you might meet a living Buddha.</p>

      <p>Pudacuo National Park retains a well-preserved ecosystem within the virgin forests. The must-see scenery in this park includes Lake Bita and Lake Shudu. 'Bita' means 'a place with a dense oak forest' in the Tibetan language and 'Bitahai' means 'a
        quiet lake'. The Bitahai Lake is surrounded by mountains covered with ancient pines, oaks, and rhododendrons, and appears like an emerald in the heart of the mountains. Shudu Lake is surrounded by a forest of fir, spruce, and silver birch, and
        is home to lots of wild animals, such as squirrels, golden cats, and pheasants. Stay overnight in Shangri-La.</p>

  <h2>Trip Notes</h2>

  <h3>1. Tailoring Your Tour</h3>

  <p>This tour is very flexible. You can alter the itinerary, and extend or shorten it to suit your price, interest, and schedule. Feel free to tell us your requirements, and we will be happy to help you arrange a tour using our professional knowledge and
    experience. We promise a "No Shopping Policy".</p>

  <h3>2. Getting There and Traveling Away</h3>

  <p>Kunming is a convenient transportation hub. There are domestic flights to most of China's major cities, such as Beijing, Xi'an, Guilin, Chengdu and Shanghai. International routes include flights between Kunming and Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur,
    Rangoon and Singapore.</p>

  <p>Shangri-La is a good choice to connect Lhasa in Tibet. There is a daily flight from Shangri-La to Lhasa: MU5939 (10:45-12:45) (schedule for reference).</p>

  <h3>3. About visiting Lama's dormitory</h3>

  <p>This visit cannot be arranged in March, October, or November due to the religious activities of the lamas during these times. It could also be suspended at other times if the lamas need to attend to some activities, such as being invited by villagers
    to host a ceremony.</p>

  <h3>4. Hotel</h3>

  <p>Hotels with a convenient location, regional features and good reviews are recommended in the itinerary. If you prefer other hotel options (luxury hotels, boutique hotels, or economical choices) or would like to book the hotels on your own, please feel
    free to inform us and we will be happy to adjust the details.</p>

  <p>Note: The boutique hostels in Yunnan offer good value for money: a decent environment, local-style decoration, and a convenient location, but most of them only have 10–20 rooms and there may not be any English-speaking staff. Early booking is highly
    recommended.
